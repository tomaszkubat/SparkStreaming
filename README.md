# Intro
This document is a short brochure about my postgraduate project with Apache Spark Structured Streaming in action. Full documentation can be found here: ![documentation](https://github.com/tomaszkubat/SparkStreaming/tree/master/doc/documentation.pdf)

Project contains:
- two small Scala applications,
- map visualization in R
- a few additional bash scripts to ensure handy operating with applications.

Whole solution is rather an example (small Spark in-action demo) than a production-ready solution. In the documentation are enclosed some annotations about possibloe prodctions upgrades. E.g. it would be great to use Apache Kafka Streams as a data broker to provide fully data integration and streaming solution, which i didn't use, because it was out of scope.


# Purpose
My goal was to analyze air pollution data from Lombardia (Italy), publicized by ARPA Agency Regional Agency for Environmental Protection). 
Streaming, analysing, visualising air pollution data stream from Lombardia.

# Configuration
Befor running an applications some configuration steps are required. Configuration process was described in the documentations 'Configuration' section: ![documentation](https://github.com/tomaszkubat/SparkStreaming/tree/master/doc/documentation.pdf)
